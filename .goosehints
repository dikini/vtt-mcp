Use Beads (bd) as the canonical task tracker for this repo.

When the user asks about tasks, blockers, priorities, or "what to do next":
- Prefer running `bd ready --json` and summarizing.
- Use `bd show <id> --json` for details.

When you create/update/close/link Beads tasks:
- Batch changes as needed, then ALWAYS run `bd sync` before ending the session.

PR workflow:
- If `gh` is available and authenticated, you may use it to help prepare PR titles/bodies.
- Otherwise, generate PR text in markdown.
