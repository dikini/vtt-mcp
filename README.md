# Minimal Linux Voice Interface

A Rust-based Linux voice interface supporting local speech recognition (voice-to-text) and speech synthesis (text-to-speech), designed to integrate with Goose.

This project starts with a minimal structure. The architecture (monolithic app, bridging daemon, modular services, etc.) will be decided after initial research. Code and Cargo.toml layout will be refactored based on emerging needs and selected voice/speech libraries.

## Initial Research Checklist
- Local voice-to-text options for Linux (Rust-friendly)
- Text-to-speech solutions (Linux/Rust)
- Integration approaches with Goose
- Deployment and packaging strategies
- UI options (no commitment yet)

---
Structure and workflows will evolve as requirements become clear.
