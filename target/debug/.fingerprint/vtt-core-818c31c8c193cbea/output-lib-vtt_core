// a is borrowed as immutable.\n    bar(a); // error: cannot borrow `*a` as mutable because `a` is also borrowed\n            //        as immutable\n    println!(\"{}\", y);\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this error, ensure that you don't have any other references to the\nvariable before trying to access it with a different mutability:\n\n```\nfn bar(x: &mut i32) {}\nfn foo(a: &mut i32) {\n    bar(a);\n    let y = &a;
